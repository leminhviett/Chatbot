## Project Overview
This project aims to create a simple chat bot using machine learning. This chat bot will be able to help me to answer messages whenever I am not available.

##  Building Model
To pre-process the data, I use some Natural Language Processing techniques to define various tasks corresponding with some specific words.

And then I build a deep learning model with Pytorch. My model will classified the message to specific predefined task and then give response. 

## What I have learnt
- Applied some Natural Language Processing like bag-of-words, tokenization with NLTK
- Implemented a classification model using Pytorch
- Deployed this model using Flask
